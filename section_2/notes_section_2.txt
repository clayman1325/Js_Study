# Basic syntax and functions
    dive into core syntax
    variables and data types
    operators
    explore and use functions.

# Seting up the project
    First download the scaffold of the calculator project from the Udemy course.

    verify that the html is working fine and add a app.js file in scripts to add more js functionalities.
        to BEGIN with try only one alert mesage that will pop up when the calculator renders

        to do that there exist different ways using the <script> tag and appending the code between its open and close tags. However
        that is not a good practices as long as it wont be clean nor easy to mantain when the js growths. And because now a days JS
        can growth significantly its prefere to split all the js code separate from the HTML or css code and import it (unless the amount of code
        is short as it should be in framewokrs such as React or Vue js).

        In this case what can be done is inject the JS code to the html throuhg importing the app.js file in the scripts folder in the HTML index
        file seting the correct url in src attribute of the <script> tagg.

# Variables
    What is allowed and what is not allowed
    Describe what the variable stores
    camel case  and case sensitive.
    only letters and digits
    $ is allowed (weird though)
    _ is allowed not so weird.

    let currentResult;  // This variable is declared but not defined or initialized

    ; is the symbol to end the line of a word or sentence.

# operators
    syntax that allow us to manipulate variables values.


# Numbers
    integers
    float
    strings  '' "" ``
        string contatenation is done using ` ${ } ` backticks and operators that can be called template literal.
        '\ ' a backslash scapes the meaning of the followin character to add special characters to a string
        such as backspace \n etc
