## ObjectOrientedPrograming
    a way of thinking and reasoing about the code

    code in term of entities.
        entities that has attributes and properties or methods.

    Product list
        render products
        fetch a list of products


    product
        details
        add to a card

    Shoping cart
        totals and order the products

    with oop you wrapp and encapsulate the logic that belongs to one entitiy only to they to write more clean and
    mantainable code.

## Classes and Instances:

### Classes
        A class is a blue print for objects
        define how an object would look like

### Objects
        ara what we work with code data structures that holds useful information.
        can be instances of classes.

### static properties and fields
    static is a reserved word that can prepend a property method or field that will belong to the class and not to the instance level

### when to write classes and object literals are obsolete?
    object literals are good for:
        group data,
        objects that you only create once,
        quick and ease to create no overhead

    when not
        greate when needs to be recreated over and over again
        greate if the creation follows a certain template in properties or functions DRY principle.
        Easy object duplication
